    title: How To Join
    desc: Basically to join our team you have to have a certain talent that can qualify you to get in any other team and you have to be mentally prepaired and be able to put in effort to be at every game. (yes family and more important matters are resonable for you to not be at the games). You can be picked up when being scouted or at tryouts if we really like how you play and your spirit.
